If you're a software engineer worried about AI replacing you and losing your job just because it's all you're seeing on your feed, let me tell you, you're already thinking about the wrong thing.

After 15 years in tech and seeing trends and shifts come and go, I can tell you quite certainly that right now, we're on a major shift.

But none of them can think about what should be built, why it matters, or how real-world users will interact with it. AI will write the “what,” but only humans can truly define the “why” and the “how.”

Earlier, it used to be:
– “Can you code this feature?”
Now it will be:
– “Can you decide what feature actually solves the problem?”

Earlier:
– “Are you good at algorithms and syntax?”
Now:
– “Are you good at spotting edge cases, gaps, and bad assumptions in what AI gives you?”

Earlier:
– “Can you write a thousand lines of code?”
Now:
– “Can you design a flow, break it into smart prompts, and review the AI’s work critically?”

Earlier:
– “Can you turn a Jira ticket into code?”
Now:
– “Can you turn a business problem into the right Jira tickets and make sure AI doesn’t miss the nuance?”

Earlier:
– “How fast can you ship features?”
Now:
– “How well can you connect dots, see the bigger picture, and make 80% of your ideas work through delegation and automation?”

Earlier:
– “Do you know the hottest framework?”
Now:
– “Can you adapt, learn new tools, and guide your team (and the AI) to results that matter?”

The value is shifting from writing code to thinking about code
Critical thinking, product sense, design taste, and judgment- these are the real differentiators.

AI is here to help, not replace you. Only if you level up how you think (not just what you code), you’ll always have a seat at the table, no matter what tool comes next.
